# PubkicMarketPriceHandler
We would like to connect to a FX price feed of spot prices from the market. With each price, we want to modify it by applying a commission.  We want to make this available to clients(history is not required). You can imagine a UI, you do not need to write a UI. Assume that the Bid means the sell price(lower) and the Ask is the buy price(higher).
